# ocean-memory-project

The Ocean Memory project harnesses 24 years (1993–2017) of Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 monthly reanalysis data to uncover the dynamical underpinnings of sea surface temperature (SST) persistence in the equatorial Pacific (5°S–5°N, 170°–240°E). Through a self-contained Kaggle Jupyter notebook, we processed a ~705 MB NetCDF subset (289 timesteps; variables: SST/thetao, salinity/so, currents/uo/vo, SSH/zos, mixed-layer temperature/mlotst at ~0.49 m depth), engineering ~20 physically informed features (e.g., lagged SST for autoregression, advection proxies like uo*SST, deseasonalized anomalies to isolate interannual signals) and pruning to an 8-feature core via VIF/correlation analysis for low multicollinearity.
At its core, the project deploys a hybrid pipeline blending Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) for sparse ODE discovery—yielding a linear backbone dSST/dt ≈ -0.108 × SST_anom + 0.110 × SSH_anom - 0.088 × Current_speed with a novel 9.3-month e-folding memory timescale (R² ≈0.50 for derivatives)—and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) ensembles for probabilistic forecasting, achieving R² up to 0.88 (OLS/PySR persistence), 0.76 (GPR physics-only), and 0.65 (XGBoost non-linear) on held-out tests (post-2010). Exploratory diagnostics (wavelets for 2–7 year ENSO bands, PCA capturing ~80–90% variance in 2–3 modes, regime clustering with silhouette ≈0.65) and SHAP interpretability reveal synergistic interactions (e.g., MLD amplified by SSH), while hybrid simulations expose atmospheric stochasticity via out-of-sample divergence (test R² -3.4, reframed as predictability bounds).
